//
//  Stage 2 recording: AVAudioRecorder (not AVAudioEngine) -- chosen because
//  this app only needs "record to a file, then read it back once recording
//  stops," which is exactly AVAudioRecorder's use case. AVAudioEngine is
//  built for real-time streaming/tap access to live buffers, which this
//  project explicitly does NOT need yet (real-time streaming inference is
//  out of scope per context.md's "Explicitly out of scope" list) --
//  AVAudioEngine would be the right tool if/when a live-streaming Stage
//  existed, not for this record-then-process flow.
//
//  Records directly at 16kHz mono Float32 PCM (matching the model's
//  expected input format exactly) via AVAudioRecorder's settings dict, so
//  no post-recording sample-rate/channel conversion step is needed at all
//  -- Stage 1's AVAudioConverter path in ModelRunner.swift stays as
//  dead-but-correct code for the bundled test .wav (which is also already
//  16kHz mono, so that path isn't exercised in practice either) and would
//  only be exercised if a future input source arrives in a different
//  native format.
